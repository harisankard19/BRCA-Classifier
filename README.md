## Breast Carcinoma (Cancer) Classification Models (old project)



There are 3 models that I have made:

* Simple ML based
* Neural Network Based - Tensorflow and Keras based
* Neural Network Based - PyTorch based



Notes:

* All 3 use the same UCLA Wisconsin Dataset of Fine Needle Biopsy of BRCA from nearly 540 patients
* This dataset performs exceptionally well on ML and DL based models, with both giving > 95% accuracy on both TRAIN and VALIDATION data, in distinguishing CANCER from NON-CANCER
